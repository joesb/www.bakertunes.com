## Services For Education Music Services

[Services For Education Music Services](http://servicesforeducation.co.uk/) are a Birmingham based company with charitable status. They provide an amazing service to the young people of Birmingham through teaching, playing and learning music.

I have worked with them for over twenty years and am so proud of the dedication of all the staff to bring a powerful musical experience to the children encountered each week.

In 2012 I was made Vocal Composer in Residence and have composed songs for the massed primary choir events at Symphony Hall each year since. This is a wonderful opportunity to write for a huge choir and provide material that is tailored to the needs of the occasion.

I also write songs for specific topics in schools when teachers ask me whether I have a song for their current topic. This has covered Tudors, castles, transport and bugs among other things. 

I have yet to write a song about teeth, but I am sure it will come one day!
