## Services For Education Music Services

[Services For Education Music Services](http://servicesforeducation.co.uk/) are a Birmingham based company with charitable status. They provide an amazing service to the young people of Birmingham through teaching, playing and learning music.

I have worked with them for over twenty years and am amazed at the dedication of all the staff to bring a powerful musical experience to the children encountered each week.

## 2016/17

This academic year I am also working in Bournville School as composer in residence on a project about pollination.
