This is a solo piano improvisation, played at the time when my Dad was knocked over by a car and seriously injured. 

He suffered severe head and leg injuries and was in hospital for some time. During this period I experienced the trauma of seeing my Dad in pain and suffering, but also the immense love and care that we received from friends and family who were supporting us through a difficult time. 

The piece uses dissonance and resolution to capture some of these mixed emotions.
