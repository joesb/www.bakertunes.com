This is a solo piano piece that tries to describe the beauty of the sky in mid-autumn. 

We have had some beautiful skies this autumn, here in England. The soft blue, streaked with wisps of white cloud contrasts beautifully with the oranges and reds of the leaves on the trees. 

It makes me feel peaceful and content to see it.

In the piano piece, the performer need to have a gentle touch and to play the chords lightly, bringing out the tone of the top notes. It should have a wispy, cloud-like sound, so the forte passages should not be over-played.
