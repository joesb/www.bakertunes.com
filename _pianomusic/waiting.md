I love to sit at the piano and just make up melodies and chords.

"Waiting" is a piano piece that came from doing just that - waiting for something to finish and playing the piano to fill the time. The melody has an improvised feel to it and the repetitive left hand should give the impression of biding the time in a relaxed way.
