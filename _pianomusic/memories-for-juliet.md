I always enjoy writing music for particular people. It is a privilege to think about friends and family and create music that may encapsulate something special about them. I have always found that music can speak to people in ways that are far more eloquent than anything I could say.

This piece was written as a present for a friend's birthday. I hope it reflects something of the depth of friendship we share and creates a thoughtful mood in which memories can be pondered.
