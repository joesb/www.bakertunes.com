This musical miniature pairs with my last piece,  _A moment …_ The harmonic language is similar, and motifs are further explored in this second piece. I have worked with the idea of colourful snatches of time, momentary sounds or experiences that seem to float in the breeze and then disappear - maybe the distant sounds of street musicians or a carnival some way off.
