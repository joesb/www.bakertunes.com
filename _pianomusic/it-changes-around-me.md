It feels as if the world is rapidly transforming and changing. Simple things that were so insignificant are now transformed in a disturbing way. There is a longing for the restoration of the familiar.

Transformation is a piece that unexpectedly shifts and moves tonality and merges dissonance with resolution as if describing that sense of yearning in the midst of transition.
