Twilight is a solo piano piece that captures the mysterious moments of twilight, when the day closes and the night is beginning to settle in. My imagination loves the idea of shadows and magic in the air.

The repeated motif in the treble needs a light touch with rubato as the performer feels appropriate. The chordal interludes add the contrasting, unexpected moments as if the night shadows grow, or glimpses of unknown things are seen. Use dynamics to add colour and effect here.
