Einaudi's music appeals to so many different people and a lot of my teenage pupils really enjoy playing his music. However, the pieces are often quite long and those who are still fairly new to the piano find them daunting for that reason.

I have been inspired to write some short pieces in a similar style for those who need something a bit easier, but still musically satisfying.

My intention is to keep the pieces within a fairly small range and to use the broken chord accompaniment style that gives the works a flowing quality. Melody lines are simple but require a good projected sound.

Please feel free to download the score and share.
