A lot of my music is composed using a midi keyboard and Logic Pro X on a Mac computer. 

I have done all the arrangements for my songs in this way and love the huge variety of instruments available to me.

I enjoy the challenge of composing all the parts for the different members of a band or orchestra, and to have to listen for the various layers that are needed to make a backing or composition sound complete. 

Sometimes the timbre of an instrument itself will inspire melodies and styles, and occasionally I accidentally come across loops or effects that transform my arrangement.

This is an area of constant experiment and growth which I hope to develop more in the future.
