By Your Side is an instrumental arrangement with piano as the main focus and a sax solo in the middle section. 

I improvised the main melody while thinking about a friend who was coming to terms with her father dying. I wanted to write music that was sensitive and thoughtful, but also contained joy and life to reflect the positive memories she had of him.
