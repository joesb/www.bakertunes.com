title: It's Up To Me To Choose
---

In the news this morning there has been a lot of mention of the angry and hateful responses to the decision made by three high court judges earlier in the week about the legal requirements surrounding the Brexit negotiations. The judges are experiencing abusive and threatening messages via social media, and the validity of the legal system is under attack.

In the primary schools I work in, here in Birmingham, we teach the children a lot about respect of others, being thoughtful, being measured in our responses and, above all, being kind and considerate. In many playgrounds there are the Rules of the playground encapsulating these values. These lessons are increasingly essential as children become adults entering the world of social media where words and actions can have far reaching consequences.

Singing Connections is a project run by Services For Education that uses singing to reinforce education. I was commissioned to write a set of songs that complemented the Birmingham Agreed Syllabus for RE. Many of the songs tackle issues of decision making, right choices, community and standing up for beliefs. My hope is that these positive values will become deeply embedded as the children sing and remember the songs throughout their lives.

Here is an example of one of these songs, "It's Up To Me To Choose" sung by children from Colmore Junior school and Watermill primary school.
