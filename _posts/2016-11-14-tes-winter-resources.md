I have been busy today uploading a few songs to the Tes.co.uk website where I have a growing collection of music.

I have included some songs I wrote last year for a Christmas show at a local primary school. These songs were on the theme of a snowman's journey and the nativity, and the songs were a combination of winter-themed pieces, with some more traditional Christmas ones.
