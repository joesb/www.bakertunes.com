Music has always been my way of communicating my emotions. As a young girl, playing the piano in the evening in a darkened room was where I did my processing and explored the feelings that were working inside.

There has been a lot in the news that concerns me. As a mum to four beautiful daughters, I long to give them the hope of a bright future with a beautiful planet and harmony among people.

Sadly, this is not looking likely at the moment.

In response to the events in America yesterday, 9th November, when a new president was elected, I wrote this piano piece to try and gain some sense of the emotions I was feeling.
