title: A Primary Nativity Is More Than A Musical
---

I'm squashed onto a tiny chair between two strangers, waiting expectantly. Cheesy Christmas music plays, almost drowned out by the chatty voices of a large audience. The roof of the school hall has been incredibly transformed by hanging glittery umbrellas and stars gently twirling and casting shadows on the walls. A rather remarkably life-like fireplace with flames glowing sets a domestic scene in one corner and a huge cardboard outline of a stable stands opposite.

It's the [Watermill Primary School](http://www.watermill.bham.sch.uk/) nativity play and I'm here on my third performance to conduct the children in the songs. Not that they need me really. These kids are remarkable in the way they learnt the music so quickly and securely. But I like to think I'm needed so sit there, waving my arms around and trying not to sing along to my favourite numbers.

## Whole School 

Each year we experience the craziness of putting on a whole school production at Watermill. It has become a tradition and a source of some pride that we get more creative and ambitious each year. That's saying something when the base line is that each pupil in the school has a proper part to play in the performance. So there are dances, musicians, lighting experts, sound engineers and narrators, as well as the main acting roles and, of course, the choir. 

## My Role

My role is to teach and provide the songs that link the action together. This may involve sorting out backing tracks, adapting lyrics or writing new material. It's hard to fit it in sometimes, but it's always worth it. The pupils are so responsive and really seem to take ownership of this show. I've taught at Watermill in my capacity as vocal teacher for [Services For Education](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) for over twenty years now and there's a really strong singing tradition in the school.

The singing went really well today and I was proud of what we've done together, but the reason I sat there at the end, close to tears, was different. 

## Everyone With A Role To Play

This is a school of many different children from a huge range of backgrounds and experience. There are some who can hardly speak English, and some with quite major educational needs. But this production, incredibly put together by all the staff in the school, was a triumphant celebration of achievement. The older children danced with the younger ones, giving a lead and guiding gently if necessary. Small groups of dancers as young as 6 and 7 masterfully negotiated their routines, giving a little nudge with an elbow here and there if classmates were in the wrong place. I watched, amazed, at the look of concentration on the faces of children who find it hard to engage in the classroom, as they performed their part to their parents. Small improvisations took place as the older actors began to relax and enjoy their audience. It was even great watching the whole school stand and sit at the correct times to sing their songs without any prompting from teachers.

## Performing Arts and Their Unique Role

The warmth of applause from the audience at the end was a testimony to the success of this show. I sat there more convinced than ever that the performing arts have an absolutely crucial and unique part in schools' teaching curricula. These children had all experienced a happy, fun and excellent experience. Each one had successfully contributed to the whole school project and done themselves proud. New skills had been learnt and old ones refined and improved. They left the hall buzzing with it and I believe were a few inches taller because of it.
