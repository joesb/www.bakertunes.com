This is a recording of my song, Poppy Red, taken  in the classroom of a local Birmingham school.

It was very moving to see the children from many different countries in the world, some of which are at war with each other, singing about the hope of peace and unity.

It seems appropriate to include it here in my blog today when we especially remember those killed in war.
