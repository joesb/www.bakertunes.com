title: My publications on the site

Finally got round to updating my website and have added some new publications. Lots of Christmas stuff, ready for the festive season, and some songs for the rest of the year.

I've been particularly enjoying teaching songs from the Singing Connections collection and hearing primary kids sing about making good choices and helping others.
