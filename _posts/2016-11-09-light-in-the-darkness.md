title: Light In The Darkness
---

I woke up this morning to the news that Donald Trump is the new president of America. 

This scares me, if I'm honest. I know I'm not alone. 

I wanted to write a piece of music that described my emotions - sadness, fear, confusion, disbelief, anger. 

But then I saw a tweet that reminded me that there is hope still to be found, and there is light in the darkness. 

I have had a Christian faith since a child and was inspired three years ago to write a song in response to a Nativity scene I saw with the well-known halo around the baby Jesus, shining out and lighting up the darkness of the stable. For me, the life of Jesus is inspirational in its selflessness, courage, kindness and strength. 

I was glad to be reminded of this today and have decided that a song about light in the darkness is more helpful to me in this time of turmoil and fear.

I hope this might help others too, and bring a little hope.
