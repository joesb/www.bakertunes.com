title: Busy Buzzing Bumble Bees
---

Bournville Junior School, Birmingham UK, have been busy working on a project about pollination for their Arts Mark awards. 

As a visiting composer, I have been working with year 5 on some music compositions based on this theme. We've seen some wonderfully creative pieces and have come up with the verses for a song together. 

I woke up one morning with the words "busy buzzing bumble bees" and "purposefully pollinating right in front of me" in my head! These have become the main themes for the chorus and the children have given me some great ideas for the rest of the song.

Here they are singing today.
