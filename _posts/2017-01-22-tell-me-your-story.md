## Differences

This week in schools I have started to teach a song I wrote for [Services For Educations's](http://servicesforeducation.co.uk/index.php/Music-Services/primary-schools.html?option=com_content&view=article&id=241&Itemid=653&lang=en#singing-connections) Singing Connections resource.

Tell Me Your Story is a song about differences and respect. As we listen to other people's stories, we can start to appreciate these differences and so build bridges that enable us to live together in unity and harmony. In a period of history when it seems as if politically it is very difficult to hold different opinions cohesively and diversity seems to be under threat, this song tells a different story.

"Let's build a bridge of hope and kindness, a bridge of love and peace, a bridge of respect and unity that makes the world a better place"

## Hope

As I hear children singing these words it makes me hopeful that, even if my generation seems to have forgotten those values of peace and respect, maybe we can still inspire our children to do things differently.
