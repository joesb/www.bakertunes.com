I spent a couple of hours this afternoon at the rehearsal for the Birmingham Schools singers.

This is an auditioned choir for the secondary pupils of Birmingham and meets once a month to rehearse together under the director, Ruth Roberts.

It was a real joy today to hear the choir rehearse works in three parts, including Sway by Pablo Beltran Ruiz, arranged by Kirby Shaw, and Let it Snow! by Cahn and Styne, arranged by Joyce Eilers Bacak.

I was struck by how mature their voices sounded (I'm so used to the primary choir sound!), and how the pupils' musicianship was really starting to come through in the music. For these teenagers, giving up 3 hours on a Sunday is a big commitment but that dedication is really beginning to come through in the sound they are making.

The choir's first performance is on Wednesday 9th November at St Francis Church, Bournville, where they will be part of a sharing concert for singers across the city.
