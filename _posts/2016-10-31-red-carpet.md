As Composer In Residence for Services For Education Music I write songs for the massed choir events that take place at the end of the academic year. These happen at Symphony Hall in Birmingham and are wonderful events where hundreds of school children perform to a large audience in a top concert venue. 

This year, in 2016, the theme was Hollywood and I wrote a song imagining I was dreaming about walking down the Red Carpet and how that would feel.

Here is a video of me conducting a 500-strong choir. One of the highlights of my year!
