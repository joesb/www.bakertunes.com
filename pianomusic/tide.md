Tide is a gentle piece that reminds me of the gentle lapping of the tide against the shore as it moves on a calm day. The left hand movement imitates the rocking motion of the waves while the repetition of the right hand melody with its slight changes echos the constant rising and falling of the sea, always changing, yet somehow familiar.
