The word 'Dusk' speaks to me of reflection and meditation. 

It brings to my mind the setting sun and that in-between world between day and night when the busy-ness of the day is done and the peace of the night is drawing closer.

The light changes and things seem different.

There is hope of rest and maybe the company of friends round the table for a meal.
