I've loved composing since I got my first Casio keyboard for Christmas when I was eight. Through my piano teaching and arranging work I have loads of opportunities to hear new pieces and enjoy seeing pupils experimenting with different styles.

Einaudi's music appeals to so many different people and a lot of my teenage pupils really enjoy playing his music. However, the pieces are often quite long and those who are still fairly new to the piano find them daunting for that reason.

I have been inspired to write some short pieces for piano in a similar style for those who need something a bit easier, but still musically satisfying.

My intention is to keep the pieces within a fairly small range and to use the broken chord accompaniment style that gives the works a flowing quality. Melody lines are simple but require a good projected sound.

Please feel free to download the scores and share.
