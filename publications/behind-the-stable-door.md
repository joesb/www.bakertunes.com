**Why are a cat, a dog, an ox, a donkey, a sheep and three camels all sitting outside a stable on a chilly, starry night? Well, the innkeeper’s wife has a bee in her bonnet and has declared her stable ‘out-of-bounds’ to all animals! Something very curious is happening behind the closed door and the evicted animals want to find out what it is!**

Nativity musical for KS1 & KS2 (best suited for ages 4-9).

Running time approx: 45 minutes
