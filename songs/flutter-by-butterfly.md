[*Flutter By, Butterfly*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) is from my musical [*Flutterpillar*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) published by Starshine Music. 

This is the final song of the show and celebrates the transformation of the caterpillar into the butterfly. I hope it captures a sense of joy and freedom as she spreads her wings and sees the garden from the sky for the first time.
