I have always enjoyed going round ruined castles and love to try and imagine what it was like before they were deserted.

When a friend asked me to write a song about this topic for a school she was working in, I was more than happy to have a go. It has been used countless times now by people who have seen it on [Tes.com](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/castles-6287998) and I have had some lovely feedback from teachers whose pupils have enjoyed singing it.
