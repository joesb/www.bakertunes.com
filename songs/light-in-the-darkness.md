Light In The Darkness is a song I wrote at Christmas 2012. I had been looking at the cards depicting the nativity scene with the baby Jesus lying in the manger, so often with light shining around him. In many of the cards this light would penetrate out of open stable doors into the night.

Sometimes periods of life seem full of shadows and this song reminds me that light can be found in the darkness, however faint.
