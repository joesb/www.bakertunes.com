[*Come On!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) is from my musical [*The Magical Christmas Journey*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) published by Starshine Music. 

This is the lively finishing number of the musical. I wrote it imagining the children enjoying a celebration at the end of the story, and it has obvious scope for instrumental accompaniment.

This was the first full musical that I wrote and is now also featured on the [Charanga](https://charanga.com/site/) website which is used in primary schools across the UK.
