[*Croak*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html) is the song that the croaky chorus sing in my musical, [*Croak!*](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/croak.html), published by [Out Of The Ark Music](https://www.outoftheark.co.uk/).

Hearing the evening frog chorus has a dramatic effect on Speedy the tadpole. He longs to join them and is frustrated that, although he loves swimming speedily round the pond, he can not sing and join them. The story shows how, unexpectedly, this desire is fulfilled in a marvellous way.

The video is a compilation of all the songs from the musical, with *Croak* featuring in the middle.

I have written a [blog](https://blog.bakertunes.com/croak-235becfb447d) about the musical and how my childhood memories inspired the story.
