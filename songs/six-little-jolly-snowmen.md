Six Little Jolly Snowmen is a fun song describing six little snowmen. They may have branches for their fingers, and wear woolly scarves and hats to keep out the North wind, but the best thing about them is definitely their carrot noses!

It was originally written for a school nativity production at Watermill Primary school, Birmingham, in which a magical snowman managed to help the children stop a nativity attack by Jack Frost. Especial thanks must go to Kelly Leeming for her imaginative ideas and the wonderful production we did with the whole school in 2015.
