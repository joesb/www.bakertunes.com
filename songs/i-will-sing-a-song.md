*I Will sing A Song* was originally commissioned by The West Midlands Singing Consortium for the Big Sing event at the Birmingham Symphony Hall in 2013. 

It is a peaceful song about the beauty of nature and the things in life that make me want to sing. The chorus is in two-part harmony, making this a popular song for choir performances.
