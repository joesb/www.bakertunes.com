[*See The Little Baby*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) is from my musical [*The Magical Christmas Journey*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) published by Starshine Music. 

There is often a scene in a school nativity when the characters form a montage in the stable and we see a Christmas card image for a moment. This is a very simple lullaby, written with such a scene in mind.

This was the first full musical that I wrote and is now also featured on the [Charanga](https://charanga.com/site/) website which is used in primary schools across the UK.
