[*Timber For Furniture*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) is a lively tango from my musical [*Change The World Together*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/change-the-world-together) published by Starshine Music. 

The musical explores the various ways in which trees are cut down in order to sustain human lifestyle choices. This song is the theme song for the group of loggers who earn an honest living from their trade. Timber is required by the townsfolk to build their houses and furnish their home renovations, and the loggers are there, ready to do the job required.
