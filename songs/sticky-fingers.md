This is a song I have written for SoundTots, a new programme run by [Services For Education](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) for nurseries and reception classes in Birmingham.

I am intending to write a small collection of songs based on the senses, this being the first I have composed.

I hope it will inspire conversations with the children about the things around them and what they feel like, as well as giving them opportunity to look at their fingers and count them.
