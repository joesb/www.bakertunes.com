*Give A Little Love*, published in Starshine Music's Christmas songbook, [*Here Comes Christmas!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/here-comes-christmas), is a song I have used many times in my primary choirs for Christmas concerts and events.

The lyrics are about the love, joy and hope that the birth of the baby Jesus brought in the Christian story, and how we can all share these together in our modern-day Christmas.

It has a simple two-part middle eight and ending to give something extra for performances, and a really singable melody that children seem to find easy to learn.
