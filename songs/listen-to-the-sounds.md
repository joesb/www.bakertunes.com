Listen To The Sounds is a new song I have written for [Services For Education](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) SoundTots, a scheme for supporting music in Foundation and Early years.

My intention was to write a song that encouraged children to stop and listen to sounds going on around them in the room or nearby.
