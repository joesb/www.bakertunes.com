I have always enjoyed writing new songs and writing lyrics.

My work with [Services For Education Music Services](www.servicesforeducation.co.uk) has given me many opportunities to write new material for the purposes of school life. Whether it's for a class assembly or termly project, there is scope for songs about almost anything. It's great to be given a subject and asked if I can write something for a given age group.

I have also enjoyed writing songs for friends and family over the years and hope to add more to the site as they are written.
