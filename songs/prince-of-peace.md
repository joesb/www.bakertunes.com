*Prince of Peace* is one of my favourites of the songs I have written. I use it regularly at Christmas and my choirs always seem to really enjoy singing it. 

I have always been moved by the concept of Immanuel, God with us, as I read the Christmas story each year. The chorus of this song is inspired by these thoughts and the song's title is one of the names of Christ that I find most appealing.

Published in the book [*Here Comes Christmas!*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/here-comes-christmas) by Starshine Music, it has simple harmonies and parts that are easy to learn and effective for performances.
