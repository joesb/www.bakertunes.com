[*I Like To Eat*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) is from my musical [*Flutterpillar*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/flutterpillar) published by Starshine Music. 

I like to imagine the caterpillar sitting down to a full three course dinner in this song. Of course, big green leaves are the very best, but I don't think the caterpillar really minds what it eats, as long as it is able to crunch and chew and swallow.
