This is a feel good song in two parts about the joys of singing on our own and together with others. It was written for the SFE youth proms in 2015 and I have really happy memories of both singing in the choir of 400 children, and conducting them at Symphony Hall, Birmingham.

It has a positive message about living life to the full and also watching out for others and being inclusive.

It has been included in the compilation book [*Sing A Celebration!*](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/our-offer/sing-a-celebration/), published by [Services For Education](https://www.servicesforeducation.co.uk/our-offer/sing-a-celebration/)
