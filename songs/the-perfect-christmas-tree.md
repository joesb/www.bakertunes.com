[*The Perfect Christmas Tree*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) is from my musical [*The Magical Christmas Journey*](https://www.starshine.co.uk/magical-christmas-journey) published by Starshine Music. 

*The Perfect Christmas Tree* comes early in the story when the main characters are trying to get ready for Christmas. They realise that they don't really know what the true meaning of Christmas is until a magical star takes them on a special journey.

This was the first full musical that I wrote and is now also featured on the [Charanga](https://charanga.com/site/) website which is used in primary schools across the UK.
